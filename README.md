# [C# with Speedwagon!](https://stepik.org/course/118709)
The course was accidentally found on Stepika while searching for C# courses. Completed it for fun in 2 hours. Overall, there were only pleasant feelings, a good combination of humor and learning. It's a pity that the author abandoned work on the course.
